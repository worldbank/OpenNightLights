    "### A brief overview of scaling\n",
    "Timor-Leste is a developing nation and relative to its neighbor, has lower-levels of light. As such, background light that the VIIRS instrument is sensitive to can influence interpretation. As we look at this scene, you can see the relatively high levels of \"noise\" present.\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed earlier, one approach to increase the signal / noise ratio would be to reduce data over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "But if the noise levels persist throughout the time period, that may not reduce the noise much. And what if your analysis is specifically to look at December 2017? \n",
    "\n",
    "Or what if you're looking to conduct comparative analysis on these data or use them as inputs for a model for statistical inference? \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, you will very likely want to reduce the noise levels in your data in order for your algorithm to learn your data without over-fitting (in other words, a more sensitive model might \"learn\" the noise...which is generally bad). Additionally, many loss functions are subject to \"exploding\" or \"vanishing\" gradients if your data are not close to zero and scaled.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Standardizing the image: zero mean and unit variance\n",
    "That's all important for data science and statistical inference, but out of scope for our tutorial here.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any case, there are a few ways to scale an image or matrix and prepare it for analysis or modeling and one common one is to standardize the data to be \"zero-centered\" and have unit variance. \n",
