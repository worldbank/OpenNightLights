    "1. Convert a local shapefile for Sydney, Australia to ee object for server-side operations\n",
    "2. Clip a VIIRS-DNB composite for 2018 to the City of Sydney\n",

    "\n",
    "There's a shapefile for the area of the City of Sydney Australia in the `./files/` folder in this repo. We'll access that file and convert it to an `ee` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do that, we'll use the Python `json` and <a href=\"https://geopandas.org/\">geopandas module</a>, which is a comprehensive library for geospatial analytics and data processing in Python, and create a helper function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the geopandas provides a warning about mixing conda channels...geospatial packages can get complex. Hopefully you are able to install smoothly, but there are resources <a href=\"https://geopandas.org/install.html\">on the geopandas doc page</a> if you have issues."
