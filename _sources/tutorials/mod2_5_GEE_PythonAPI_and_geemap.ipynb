    "In the last sub-module {doc}`mod2_4_introduction_to_GEE` we discussed 2 key ways to access and analyze data in GEE: 1) through the code editor and 2) the Python API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we'll describe the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python API\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-success\">\n",
    "GEE does provide <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/python_install\">some overview and documentation on the Python API</a>.</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Google Colab Python API\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-success\">\n",
    "Google also provides <a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/github/google/earthengine-api/blob/master/python/examples/ipynb/ee-api-colab-setup.ipynb\">a guide for using the Python API in a Google Colab notebook</a>.</div>\n",
    "    \n",
    "Relative to the JavaScript API and the code editor, documentation on the Python API is rather limited. The good news is that through use of two key Python modules, `earthengine-api` and `geemap` you can get much of the funcationality as in the code editor even if you have to use the JavaScript documentation as a primary reference as to how many of the data structures and algorithms work.\n",
    " \n",
    "## geemap\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-success\">\n",
    "<a href=\"https://geemap.org/\" class=\"alert-link\">geemap</a> is a Python package for interactive mapping with GEE.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "`geemap` enables users to analyze and visualize GEE datasets interactively -- including within a Jupyter environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key functionality of `geemap` is organized into several modules {cite}`wu2020geemap`: \n",
    "- `geemap`: the main module for interactive mapping with Google Earth Engine, ipyleaflet, and ipywidgets.\n",
    "- `eefolium`: a module for interactive mapping with Earth Engine and folium. It is designed for users to run geemap with Google Colab. (Note: Google colab doesnt currently integrate with ipyleaflet)\n",
    "- `conversion`: utilities for automatically converting Earth Engine JavaScripts to Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "- `basemaps`: a module for adding various XYZ and WMS tiled basemaps.\n",
    "- `legends`: a module for adding customized legends to interactive maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting started\n",
    "`geemap` is not included in the standard Python library, which means you must download and install it. Unlike `jupyter` however, `geemap` is not in the main conda repository so we will install it from the `conda-forge` channel. We will also install and use a package installer called `mamba` that makes installing geemp much faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to install `geemap` in conda:\n",
    "1. activate your env: `$ conda activate onl`\n",
    "2. install mamba via conda-forge: `$ conda install mamba -c conda-forge`\n",
    "3. install geemap via mamba: `$ mamba install geemap -c conda-forge`\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted before, you only need to install these packages into your environment once. After that, for each session (in each notebook) you just need to:\n",
    "`import geemap`\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use Python's `try` and `except` method to install a package if it is not already imported. This way we include this code in every notebook and the package will be imported if its already installed and if not, it will install it first.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE 1** since we are making these notebooks available in Google Colab, we will use `pip` to intsall packages if this notebook is running as a Colab instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE 2** if you install these libraries in a Google Colab session you will be prompted to restart your kernel in order to import the libraries."
